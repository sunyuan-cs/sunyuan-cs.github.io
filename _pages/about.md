**Yuan Sun (孙元)** is currently a postdoctoral research fellow (postdoc) at the National Key Laboratory of Fundamental Algorithms and Models for Engineering Numerical Simulation, Sichuan University, and works with Prof. [Xiaogang Deng](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1359/16695.htm). He received his Ph.D. degree from Sichuan University, advised by Prof. [Dezhong Peng](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1182/7307.htm) and Prof. [Peng Hu](https://penghu-cs.github.io/). He also collaborates closely with Prof. [Zhenwen Ren](https://unix8.net/). His research interests mainly focus on  [Hashing Learning](https://github.com/caoyuan57/Hashing) and [Noisy Correspondence](https://github.com/QinYang79/Awesome-Noisy-Correspondence). Recently, he has been conducting research related to Multi-modal Learning and [AI for PDEs](https://github.com/WillDreamer/Awesome-AI4CFD).
- **Multi-modal Learning**: It investigates multimodal fusion mechanisms or cross-modal representation learning paradigm to enable coherent integration of heterogeneous data sources for clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks.
- **AI for PDEs**: It utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve forward and inverse PDE problems as well as their applications, such as nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics.
