**Yuan Sun (孙元)** is a Ph.D. candidate at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, advised by Prof. Dezhong Peng (彭德中). His current interests mainly focus on:
- **Image Set Classification**: it constructs an image set consisting of multiple images, and then measures the distance between two sets.
- **Cross-modal Retrieval**: it uses the information of one modal to retrieve the relevant content of another modal (such as text, image, audio, video, etc.).
- **Multi-view Learning**: it integrates the supplementary and consistent information of multiple feature extractors for clustering or classification tasks.
- **AI4Science**: it utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving forward and inverse PDE problems as well as their applications (such as nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics).
